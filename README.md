# Trumpify

Lately I've seen a lot of blog posts about how people leaving ruby, how slow rails is,
how only stupid people like objects etc. Matz, DHH, Aaron? These are the same old developers
that so out of touch with the common man it's not even funny.


Enough is enough. It's time to make ruby great again.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'trumpify'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install trumpify

## Usage

Step 1: Add `require 'trumpify'` to your project.
Step 2: Replace all your methods with `make_$METHOD_NAME_great_again`.

## Example

```ruby
5.make_times_great_again { print "I know code. I have the best codes!" }
```
